This code will handle the seasonal analysis routines for pysat.  It is currently a work in progress, and will eventually replace the pysat.ssnl module in pysat.

pysatSeasons allows users to run basic seasonal analysis over N-dimensional datasets managed through the pysat code.

Main Features
-------------
- Seasonal averaging routine for 1D and 2D data.
- Occurrence probability routines, daily or by orbit.
- Scatterplot of data_label(s) as functions of labelx,y
    over a season.
